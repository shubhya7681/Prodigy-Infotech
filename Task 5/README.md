# 🚦 Task 05 – Traffic Accident Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Task Overview  
Welcome to my submission for **Task 05** of the **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**.  
In this task, I analyzed **traffic accident data** to identify patterns related to **road conditions**, **weather**, and **time of day**, and visualized **accident hotspots** along with key contributing factors.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Dataset Name:** US Accidents Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Link:**  
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas** – data loading and preprocessing  
- **NumPy** – numerical analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Folium / Plotly** – geospatial and interactive visualizations

## 🔍 Methodology  

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values and inconsistent records  
- Converted date-time features to extract hour, day, and month  
- Filtered and prepared data for spatial and temporal analysis  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Analyzed accident frequency by **time of day** and **day of week**  
- Studied the impact of **weather conditions** and **road features**  
- Identified high-risk zones using geographic coordinates  

### 3. Visualization  
- Created **heatmaps** to identify accident hotspots  
- Used **bar charts** and **line plots** to analyze trends  
- Visualized contributing factors for better interpretation

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Accident occurrences peak during rush hours  
- Certain weather conditions significantly increase accident risk  
- Specific locations show consistently higher accident density  

---

## 📌 Conclusion  
This task provided valuable insights into traffic accident patterns and contributing factors.  
The analysis highlights how data-driven approaches can support **road safety planning** and **risk mitigation strategies**.
