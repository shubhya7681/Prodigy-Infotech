# 📊 Task 02 – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Task Overview  
Welcome to my submission for **Task 02** of the **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**.  
In this task, I performed **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of my choice to explore relationships between variables and identify meaningful patterns and trends in the data.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Identified and handled missing values  
- Removed duplicate entries  
- Corrected data inconsistencies  
- Prepared data for analysis through proper formatting and transformation  

### 2. Data Analysis & Visualization  
- Analyzed relationships between variables such as age, gender, class, and survival  
- Used **bar charts**, **histograms**, and **count plots** for categorical and numerical analysis  
- Visualized correlations to identify key patterns and trends  

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Survival rate varied significantly based on passenger class and gender  
- Age distribution showed noticeable survival differences among groups  
- Certain variables demonstrated strong relationships influencing survival outcomes

## 📌 Conclusion  
This task enhanced my understanding of data cleaning techniques and exploratory data analysis.  
The insights derived from this analysis help in building intuition about the dataset and serve as a foundation for future predictive modeling tasks.
