# 🌳 Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier for Purchase Prediction

## 📌 Task Overview  
Welcome to my submission for **Task 03** of the **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**.  
In this task, I built a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their **demographic** and **behavioral** attributes.

## 🔍 Methodology  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values and inconsistent data  
- Encoded categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques  
- Scaled and prepared features for model training  

### 2. Model Building  
- Implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Tuned model parameters to improve performance  

### 3. Model Evaluation  
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score  
- Analyzed confusion matrix and classification report  
- Visualized the decision tree structure for interpretability

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Customer purchase behavior is strongly influenced by certain demographic factors  
- Decision trees provide clear interpretability of decision-making rules  
- The model effectively identified patterns leading to customer conversion

## 📌 Conclusion  
This task strengthened my understanding of **supervised machine learning**, particularly decision tree classifiers.  
The model demonstrates how customer data can be used effectively to predict purchasing behavior and support business decision-making.
