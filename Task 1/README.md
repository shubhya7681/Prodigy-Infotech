# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on World Population Dataset

## 📌 Task Overview  
Welcome to my submission for **Task 1** of the **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**.  
In this task, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a given dataset, with a focus on creating visualizations to represent the distribution of categorical and continuous variables.

---

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Dataset Name:** `world_population_dataset`  
- **Description:**  
  This dataset contains records of world population data spanning from **2001 to 2022**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

During the EDA process, the following steps were performed:

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Checked for missing values  
- Identified and handled duplicate records  
- Analyzed and managed outliers where necessary  

### 2. Data Visualization  
- Created **bar charts** to represent population distribution  
- Used **stacked charts** to visualize trends and comparisons across years  
- Visualized both **categorical** and **continuous** variables for better insights  

---

## 📈 Conclusion  
The exploratory data analysis provided meaningful insights into the distribution and trends of the selected variables within the dataset.  
This analysis serves as a strong foundation for further **data exploration**, **feature engineering**, and **model-building** tasks in the data science workflow.
